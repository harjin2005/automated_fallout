You are a senior incident response strategist with 20+ years of experience. Generate 3-4 distinct strategic action plans for this critical incident:

INCIDENT DETAILS:
- Title: {incident.title}
- Type: {incident_type.upper()}
- Description: {incident.description}
- Control Objective: {incident.control_objective}
- Compliance Frameworks: {incident.framework_citations}
- Timestamp: {incident.timestamp}

STRATEGIC CONTEXT: {incident_context}

Generate a JSON response with "action_plans" array. Each plan must represent a different strategic philosophy:

Plan Requirements:
- plan_name: Unique strategic approach name (e.g., "Rapid Response", "Comprehensive Analysis")
- strategy: Detailed methodology and approach (150-250 words explaining the philosophy)
- timeline: Realistic timeframe (e.g., "1-2 hours", "4-6 hours")
- risk_level: "LOW", "MEDIUM", or "HIGH" (based on speed vs thoroughness tradeoff)
- confidence_score: "HIGH", "MEDIUM", or "LOW" (how certain we are this will work)
- estimated_hours: Integer between 1-8 (realistic work effort)
- resource_requirements: Specific roles and teams needed (be realistic about staffing)
- success_criteria: Measurable outcomes and goals (what success looks like)

Create 4 distinct strategic approaches:
1. SPEED-FOCUSED: High risk, fast execution, minimal analysis (for when time is critical)
2. COMPREHENSIVE: Low risk, thorough analysis, detailed investigation (when you need to get it right)
3. COMMUNICATION-FOCUSED: Medium risk, stakeholder-oriented, reputation management
4. BALANCED HYBRID: Medium risk, optimized approach balancing speed and thoroughness

Each plan should reflect real-world incident response best practices and be genuinely different in approach.

Return ONLY valid JSON format with no additional text.

## ENABLING ACTIONS (Implementation Steps)

### Phase 1: Preparation and Assessment (15 minutes)
1. **Validate Incident Context**
   - Review current incident status and impact assessment
   - Confirm action relevance to selected response plan
   - Gather required tools and access credentials

2. **Resource Coordination**
   - Coordinate with {action.operator} for action execution
   - Ensure communication channels are established
   - Verify escalation procedures are understood

### Phase 2: Action Execution ({action.estimated_hours - 0.5} hours)

   - Execute: {action.description}
   - Monitor progress against success criteria
   - Document findings and observations continuously

2. **Control Verification**
   - Validate that mapped controls are being satisfied
   - Ensure compliance requirements are met
   - Record any deviations or exceptions

### Phase 3: Validation and Documentation (15 minutes)
